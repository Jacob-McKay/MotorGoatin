# MotorGoatin'

The product of a 8-ish hour hackathon, that's why there was not thought put into organization/clean-coding.  A true don't fix it if it ain't broke, just get this thing out the door effort.

I used a paid asset called VertexMotion for the jiggle effect (which I tried to configure for several hours and didn't get the effect I wanted).  Regardless that package is .gitignored due to licensing, so don't expect it to work without rejiggering the udders to not have VertexMotion Components/Data.
